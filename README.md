# Dive into Deep Learning - [book](https://d2l.ai/) 

I stumbled across this book while doing research for my bachelor thesis. I've set up to do a couple of its examples in PyTorch. If I end up enjoying it enough, I might try other frameworks like JAX or MXNet.

I realise that I'm still quite a beginner in this field and I have a lot to learn. I will start with the basics and work my way up into understanding this field to the best of my capabilities, because I want my paper to be great and actually accomplish what I set up to do: mixing the more formal automatic control theory with the field of Machine Learning. Hopefully I can make a rule based Machine Learning system that can update itself to user input based on some user provided rules.
